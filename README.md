# Math
My very own little math library! I have coded up some math in the past, but that was generally more focused on the math than the computing side of things.

Currently, my plan for this is to have lots of well-known (and some original) computational algorithms, including those for matrix multiplication, systems of ordinary/partial differential equations, integration, and polynomial evaluation.
Of course, I'll add more as I go along, but this is the plan for now.

I'll be using a couple different languages, likely with copies of the same algorithms across different languages.
A lot of these algorithms can be accelerated with parallelism, so I will largely be using low-level languages.
I'm hoping to learn about Rust throughout this process, I am always comfortable with C++, and most of my experience with parallelism is in C.
So those are the main, if only, languages that I will be using here.
